# Barrier Synchronization
In this project, I evaluate several barrer synchronization algorithms from "Algorithms for Scalable Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors" by Mellor-Crummey and Scott. Some of these are implemented using OpenMP and MPI, stanrd frameworks in shared memory and distributed architectures, and then evaluated with some experimental results.
